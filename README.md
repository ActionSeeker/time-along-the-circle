# Circle & Time

This small HTML + JavaScript demo draws a circle on an HTML5 `<canvas>` and divides it into seven arcs.
On the surface, it looks like geometry — a simple heptagon layout.
But beneath it, there is a meditation on **time**.

## Reflection

A circle has no beginning and no end, yet we insist on cutting it, dividing it, naming its parts.
Seven arcs echo the **seven days** of our week — an arbitrary rhythm we imposed on eternity.
In truth, there is no perfect compass stroke that divides a circle into seven equal parts.
Our hands cannot construct it; only our minds can imagine it.

So this code is not about geometry alone.
It is about how we slice continuity into pieces so that we can live inside it.
We cannot draw a flawless heptagon, but we can **approximate**, and approximation is the essence of how we measure days, weeks, and lives.

## Requirements

* Node.js 20.19+ or Node.js 22.12+
  (Vite requires this minimum version; older Node releases will throw “crypto.hash is not a function” errors).
* npm (comes bundled with Node).

For a quick test without Node/Vite, you can also just open `index.html` directly in your browser.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```npm install```
3. Start the dev server:
   ```npm run dev```
4. Open the provided local URL in your browser.

You will see a circle divided into seven rays. Think of them as:

* days of the week
* stages of life
* or simply, attempts to bring order to what refuses order.
